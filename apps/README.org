#+Title Apps dir

This directory is where we can create our web projects

It's not mandatory to use this directory in any way. To use this
tomcat container we just need to copy our .war file inside webapp
directory tha is mounted inside tomcat webapps dir inside the
container.

Why to use this dir, so?

There are a script ./bin/deploy-all.sh that search for any war files
inside this directory and copy them to the webapp.

To usage the script do the folowwing:

cd /thisCLonedRepoDirectory/bin
./deploy-all.sh
